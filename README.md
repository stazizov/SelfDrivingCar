# Introducion

This repository includes code (ROS2 module) from the National Technology Olympiad. 
In this track, our task was to build a system for delivering goods to a potential city. 
Equipment involved in the delivery: a small car, quadrocopter, robotic arm.

Unity code for the simulator available in [this](https://github.com/vadim-rm/NagibCarSimulator) repository. 
Docker image for connecting to the simulation available [here](https://github.com/vadim-rm/CarSimDocker).
